# Oversleeping

----------------------------------------

### Why is ==oversleeping== bad for your health?

> Sleep plays an important role in our brain as it clears out waste byproducts, balances neurotransmitters, and processes memories at rest. **However, too much sleep may have an effect on mood and mental health, such as cognition, degenerative diseases, and depression.**

More time in bed is linked with more frequent waking after sleep, reducing efficiency. Fatigue causes longer sleep, and sleeping more can make people feel more lethargic.

Underlying diseases include obstructive sleep apnea, depression, coronary disease, and declining overall health.
